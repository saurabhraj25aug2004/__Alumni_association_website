## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Login Process:
1. User enters credentials in `LoginForm`
2. Credentials sent to `/api/auth/login`
3. JWT token and user data received
4. Token stored in localStorage and Zustand store
5. User redirected to role-specific dashboard

### Route Protection:
1. `ProtectedRoute` checks authentication status
2. Verifies user role against allowed roles
3. Checks user approval status
4. Redirects unauthorized users to login
5. Shows appropriate error messages

### Token Management:
- Automatic token injection in API requests
- Token expiration handling (401 responses)
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- Persistent authentication across browser sessions
